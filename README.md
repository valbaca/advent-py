Advent of Code problems solved in Python (3.9+)

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Running

```shell
# from the project root:
$ export PYTHONPATH=.
$ python advent/year2020/day1.py # or run open file from within VS Code
<part 1 answer>
<part 2 answer>
```

Just simple scripts: Each day's script runs solo (no top-level runner) and reads input from a .txt file with the same prefix in the same directory. For example `day1.py` reads `day1.txt` from within the same directory.

## What's interesting?

- What's Advent of Code?
  - See Advent of Code's ["About"](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)
- Why Advent of Code?
  - It's fun! As opposed to grinding LeetCode, AoC has fun "flavor" and lets you solve however you want (any language or even none!). Lots of hidden easter eggs and nerdy references.
  - Non-prescriptive: you decide how you want to solve the problem: use whatever language, editor/IDE, debuggers, or libraries you want.
  - "Sneaky" concepts: I like how Advent questions are a bit subtle and uniquely challenging. What works for part 1 may not scale for part 2. Sometimes all it takes is some refactoring; other times a full rewrite might be necessary.
- [elf.py](advent/elf.py) - Santa's little helper! Where I put helper functions
  - For example, using `__file__` within a python script gives the script filename. Then, changing the `.py` to `.txt` makes it simple to put the input file next to the script
  - `septoi` (stands for "separate, to int") is an incredibly useful helper. By safely "trying" to convert to int, it keeps the "non-number" parts as strings and gives ints where possible. It also accepts a regex to split on, so it's adaptive and flexible. This is a tangible advantage of dynamic typing.
- Why Python?
  - I've used AoC to get more familiar with other languages (Go, Clojure) and it's been a fun and useful approach.
  - I'm now looking to get more familiar with Python
  - Python is the #1 language for Advent of Code, and for good reason IMO. Most problems are solved in less than 100 lines of python
  - Compare to other languages, Python has significant advantages:
    - Python emphasizes the developer's time, which for these problems is a more crucial resource vs execution time 
    - vs Java: Python is succinct, direct, and operates on a higher level (and just more fun!)
    - vs Go, Crystal, or Clojure: Python has a better debugger (or has one at all!)
    - vs Go or Java: Python's `int` (and dynamic typing in-general) is nicer than strict typing 
    - Python is the slowest language to execute, but that's still fast enough. A "correct" solution typically comes down to using the right algorithm or data structures.
